What works: Everything but Hot-Cold bit replacement, including set level lfu
What doesn't work: Hot-Cold bit replacement

EXTRA CREDIT: I implemented a least frequently used algorithm on a set-level basis,
while a broader scope would also work, in my tests, just keep track of the frequency within the set
yielded better results than lru
